My name is varshini. I am from Machilipatnam. I have done my schooling from Nagarjuna Public School.I completed my Intermediate in stream of MPC from
RK junior college, Machilipatnam. I don't have any working experience. I choose to pursue a course in Data Structures and Algorithms to expertize in DSA
which will be very helpful to get a good job in product based companies. DSA also have many applications in real life. And i also heard that many companies 
shows much more interest towards DSA which will give more opportunities to settle in life.
